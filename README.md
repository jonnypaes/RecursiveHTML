## Recursive HTML

Have your HTML file output instantaneously with Recursive HTML!

Recursive HTML is a client-side tool to test and debug small code snippets. You write the HTML code and receive the output recursively and instantaneously.

### What it has:

#### Done
* Pure HTML5 + JS (ES) + CSS3
* Single self-contained HTML file
* Dark-mode
* Syntax highlighting
* Client-side only app (Working online and local)
* Shareable links without a backend (using Base64)
* Saves content to a local file
* Saves scroll position on editor change
* Sidebar examples now can be called by link: Example: `https://www.recursivehtml.com#`[sectioning](https://www.recursivehtml.com#sectioning)
* Capturing: [Script](https://www.recursivehtml.com#scripting): `Console.log`, `console.error`, `throw new Error('!')`, [Form Submit](https://www.recursivehtml.com#forms) and Noscript
* Sublime shortcuts
* Hold fab button (mobile) & `Ctrl + S` (Computer) to save it
* Sniper-like screen to show sizes and scroll offset in canvas | [Example](https://www.recursivehtml.com/?m=0&HTML=PGRpdiBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6MjAwMHB4O2hlaWdodDoyMDAwcHgiLz4=)
* Result on a div projecting a shadow-dom
* Pressing the fab button shows the content sandbox (as an iframe)
* Full page (MAXIMIXED) rendering (`@param m=1 + HTML=...`) | [Example](https://www.recursivehtml.com/?m=1&HTML=PHA+V2VsY29tZSB0byA8Yj5SZWN1cnNpdmUgSFRNTDwvYj48L3A+)

#### Partially done
