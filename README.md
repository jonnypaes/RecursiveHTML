## Recursive HTML

Have your HTML file output instantaneously with Recursive HTML!

Recursive HTML is a client-side tool to test and debug small code snippets. You write the HTML code and receive the output recursively and instantaneously.

### What it has:

#### Done
* Pure HTML5 + JS (ES) + CSS3
* Single self-contained HTML file
* Dark-mode
* Syntax highlighting
* Client-side only app (Working online and local)
* Shareable links without a backend (using Base64)
* Saves content to a local file
* Saves scroll position on editor change
* Capturing: `Console.log`, `console.error`, `throw new Error('!')`, Form submit and Noscript | [Example](https://www.recursivehtml.com/?m=0&HTML=PHNjcmlwdD5jb25zb2xlLmxvZygnaGknKTwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8bm9zY3JpcHQ+SmF2YXNjcmlwdCBvZmY8L25vc2NyaXB0Pgk=)
* Sublime shortcuts
* Hold fab button (mobile) & `Ctrl + S` (Computer) to save it
* Sniper-like screen to show sizes and scroll offset in canvas | [Example](https://www.recursivehtml.com/?m=0&HTML=PGRpdiBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6MjAwMHB4O2hlaWdodDoyMDAwcHgiLz4=)
* Result on a div projecting a shadow-dom
* Pressing the fab button shows the content sandbox (as an iframe)
* Full page (MAXIMIXED) rendering (`@param m=1 + HTML=...`) | [Example](https://www.recursivehtml.com/?m=0&HTML=PHA+V2VsY29tZSB0byA8Yj5SZWN1cnNpdmUgSFRNTDwvYj48L3A+)

#### Partially done
* Recursive sidebar with HTML elements
* Context menu with "reverse rendering"

#### Not Done
* Working offline (Because it doesn't allow it without a service worker)

#### Uses
* [Codemirror 5](https://codemirror.net/5/)
* [Split-JS](https://github.com/nathancahill/split)
